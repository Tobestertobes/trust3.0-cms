**Overview:**

Trust 3.0 has teamed up with award-winning global brand experience agency Imagination to host a series of virtual roundtables kicking off on June 8th 2023 at 2.15pm BST.

Trust 3.0 and Imagination are jointly convening industry experts to create discourse around the best ways to build equitable and ethical data processes that are fit for purpose. 

**The Context:**

In the last 12 months, we have witnessed data, ML and AI leap into the spotlight and our collective psyche, which could prove to be one of the most fundamental shifts in our generation. 

The jump from niche interest to popular culture highlights the fact that the technology underpinning this sector goes well beyond the purely technical, and instead, has a deep impact on society, politics, geopolitics and ethics. Yet it is a complicated, technical, rapidly evolving world that can be confusing even for practitioners in the space.
